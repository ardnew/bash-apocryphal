# chkvar verifies a variable with given identifier is defined AND that it does
# not have a "false-like" value, defined as being exactly one of the following
# (possibly surrounded by whitespace):
#
#  - the empty string ""
#  - "false" (case-insensitive)
#  - 1 or more zeroes ("0", "00", "000", etc.)
#
# Input is provided by variable identifier instead of by value. For example:
#
#  - chkvar REPLY        <- ok!
#  - chkvar $REPLY       <- WRONG
